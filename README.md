# Enterprise Web Development Module - Point of Interest Web Application (Svelte Frontend)

#### Student Name: John Dennehy Student ID: 20091408

## Introduction

“A “point of interest” (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic
address. POI data has many applications, including augmented reality browsers, location- based social networking games, geocaching,
mapping and navigation systems.”

I chose to focus on Irish national monuments for this assignment.

## Svelte Frontend

For this assignment, the Svelte framework was used to develop a front-end service which interacts with a back-end Hapi.js API to provide users with a range of functionality around managing a collection of Irish national monuments.
